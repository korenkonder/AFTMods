# AFTMods
Various mods for Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix+

## DivaGL
Ports graphics of PDAFT 7.10 from legacy OpenGL to modern one. Works on Nvidia GPUs as well as on AMD and Intel GPUs (last statement needs testing).

The use of DivaGL and/or its code and/or its shaders and the author of this plugin must be acknowledged in content created using anything above.

## OPD Play Gen
Generates OPD files on demand if not present. Also allows files to be cached. It only generates cache for missing motions or modules. If FARC with OPD is present, and OPD file inside that FARC is present too, it won't do anything and will load existing data.

## Rob Tex Anim
Allows usage of Auth3D Object's Texture Transform and Texture Pattern in Rob

## Sprite Draw Limit
Breaks limit for Sprite Draw. (Prevents displaying of mess on screen if too many sprites are shown)
